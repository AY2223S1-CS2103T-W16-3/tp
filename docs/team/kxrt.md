#### Overview

checkUp is a desktop patient medical record management system. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Enhancements implemented

- Obtaining count of all patients: `count`
  - What it does: Returns count of all patients in the application, along with prescription counts for long-term medicine.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to easily keep track of total patient count.
- Creating past appointments for patients: `appt`
  - What it does: Creates a record of a past appointment for a patient in the application, with details such as the date
  of the appointment, the doctor's diagnosis and the medication prescribed during the appointment.
  - Justification: Significant feature for the application as it allows storing a history of patient visits that can
  later be accessed by date or by patient. This improves the medical record system by integrating patient history.
  - Highlights: Adding this impacted many currently existing commands, such as `add` and side effects caused by the
  `edit` command. This was a challenging addition that required editing of over 20 files simultaneously.
- Creating upcoming appointments for patients: `edit upcoming/`
  - What it does: Schedules a future appointment for a patient.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to keep track of when a patient is next due for a visit.
- UI changes to PersonViewPanel to beautify it from a rudimentary text layout.
- Created application [logo](../images/checkUp_512.png).

#### Contributions to the UG

- Documented `count`, `appt`, `view`, `delappt` commands.
- Updated documentation for `edit`, `add` and `find` commands to reflect changes made to them.
- Updated command summary.
- Rewrote introduction and added a section on the purpose of the application. 
- Created banner [image](../images/checkUp_banner.png). 

#### Contributions to the DG

- Added "Patient Administrator/Staff" to glossary.
- Added documentation for the Appointment feature as a whole, including:
  - A description of the feature.
  - Class and object diagrams for the feature's implementation.
  - A possible use case with outlined steps for the feature.
  - A sequence diagram of the use case with method calls shown. [TBA]

#### Contributions to team-based tasks

- Set up project workspace and team repository with member management.
- Set up code coverage, CI, CD on team repository.
- Set up CD for pull requests on team repository using Netlify.
- Created priority and type tags in team repository.
- Created and managed milestones `v1.1`, `v1.2`, `v1.2b`, `v1.3`, `v1.3b`, `v1.4` progress in the team.
- Ensured team was on schedule with frequent reminders on deadlines and pending tasks.
- Scheduled tasks for team members and ensured they were completed on time.
- Checked for code quality and adherence to coding standards.

#### Review/mentoring contributions

- Reviewed multiple PRs across the different SDLC versions.
- Planned Appointment feature and its integration with the other features in the application.
