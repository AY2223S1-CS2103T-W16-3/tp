##### Enhancements implemented

- Updating `Person` class to support patient specific fields
  - Description: `Person` now supports `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `NextOfKin`, `PatientType`, `HospitalWing`, 
    `FloorNumber`, `WardNumber`, `Medication`, `UpcomingAppointment` and `PastAppointment` fields
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to store personal information needed for patients.
- Creating new patient profiles: `add`
  - Description: Adds new patients with their all their personal particulars.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to store new patients in the app.
- Editing current patient profiles: `edit`
  - Description: Edits the personal particulars of current patients in the app via the index of the patient.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to update existing patient particulars in the app.
- Creating the Patient Details Panel: `PersonViewPanel`
  - Description: A new Ui component which displays all of a patient's details in one place. It defaults to the first 
    patient in the database and the most recent added / edited patient.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to quickly view and access a patient's information without having to type in 
    multiple commands.
- Changing the patient viewed in the Patient Details Panel: `view`
  - Description: Manually changes the patient being displayed via the index via the index of the patient.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to quickly view and access all their patients' information.
- Clicking on Patient Details Panel to edit the selected patient particulars: `PersonViewPanel`
  - Description: Clicking on the fields in the Patient Details Panel brings up the relevant edit command in the 
    Command Box.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to have quickly edit a patient's particulars without having to type in the whole
    `edit` command.
- Creating upcoming appointments for new patients: `add ua/`
  - What it does: Schedules a future appointment for a patient directly from the `add` command.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to quickly create an upcoming appointment for a new patient.
- Deleting past appointments: `delappt`
  - What it does: Deletes the most recent past appointment for the patient selected via his/her index. 
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to change the past appointment of a patient if it is documented incorrectly or 
    if new information needs to be added.
- Creating keyboard shortcuts: `CommandBox` and `CommandHistory`
  - What it does: `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to navigate previous commands, `Ctrl + Shift + C` to clear the command text.
  - Justification: Allows medical staff to quickly navigate previous commands and clear input text quickly to reduce
    the amount of key presses to carry out repetitive tasks.
- Consulting a patient: `consult`
  - What it does: Create a past appointment for the current date and clear the upcoming appointment for the current 
    date(if present). The patient is selected by his/her index.
  - Justification: Allows doctors to quickly document their consultation with a patient without having to enter 
    multiple commands.
