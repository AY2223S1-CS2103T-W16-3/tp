## **Introduction**

checkUp is a desktop application for medical practitioners to manage their patients' medical records. In this developer
guide, we will describe the architecture and design of the application. This guide is mainly for developers who wish to
enhance or create their own version of checkUp. You may refer to the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for instructions on how
to use the application. 

### **Technologies**

checkUp is written in Java 11 and uses JavaFX to create the GUI. Gradle is used for building and managing the project.
Testing is done using JUnit.

### **Functions**

checkUp's features include creating, viewing and managing patients' medical records by storing data such as their:
* personal information;
* next-of-kin information;
* past appointment and visit history;
* upcoming appointments and visits;
* long-term medication prescriptions; and
* location in the hospital (for inpatients).

checkUp also allows users to:
* search for patients by:
  * name;
  * location in the hospital; and
  * long-term medication.
* view the total number of patients in the system; and
* view the total number of patients under specific long-term medication prescriptions.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) 
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). 
It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues  
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API 
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using 
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component 
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the 
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is 
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` 
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a 
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse 
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as 
  a `Command` object.
* When parsing a `get` command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates a `GetCommandParser` to parse the prefix of the 
  `get` command (e.g., `/hw`). If the `get` command only requires a prefix (e.g., `get /inp` & `get /outp`), the 
  respective `GetXYZCommand` object is created. If the `get` command requires parameters (e.g., `get /hw North`), the 
  prefix is parsed accordingly within the `GetCommandParser` before the respective `GetXYZCommandParser` is created to
  parse the parameters and create the appropriate `GetXYZCommand` to be returned.
* All `XYZCommandParser` and `GetXYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) 
  inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores all registered patient data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a 
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they 
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both patient data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only 
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects 
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Appointments feature

![AppointmentClassDiagram](images/AppointmentClassDiagram.png)

The class diagram above visualises the `Appointment` package. The members of the `Medication` class have been hidden.

**Implementation**

The appointment creation mechanism is facilitated by its own `Appointment` component under the `Model` component. There
are 2 types of appointments, namely, `PastAppointment` and `UpcomingAppointment`.

- Both of these extend the abstract `Appointment` class, which implements the `Appointment#getDate()` operation.
- The static method `Appointment#isValidDate()` helps check against invalid date inputs for appointment creation.

#### `PastAppointment`

`PastAppointment`s represent a completed appointment for a patient. They are guaranteed to be immutable as they
constitute of sensitive patient data. Apart from `date`, `PastAppointment`s also require the following:

* `diagnosis`
  * Stored as a string, and is compulsory for the creation of a `PastAppointment`. Represents the doctor's analysis of
    the patient's state in the appointment, and is input using the `diag/` prefix.
  * Exposed using the `PastAppointment#getDiagnosis()` method for use in `JsonAdaptedPastAppointment`.
* `medication`
  * Stored as a set of medication tags, a `PastAppointment` may contain 0 or more medicine tags. Each medicine tag is
    input separately with a `m/` prefix.
  * Exposed using the `PastApointment#getMedication()` method for use in `JsonAdaptedPastAppointment`.

The following Sequence Diagram represents the creation of a `PastAppointment` using a `PastAppointmentCommand`:
[![PastAppointmentCommandSequenceDiagram](images/PastAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)](images/PastAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### `UpcomingAppointment`

`UpcomingAppointment`s represent an upcoming appointment for a patient. They only contain the `date` of the upcoming
appointment. A patient can only have a **maximum of 1** `UpcomingAppointment` at any given time.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the appointment mechanism behaves at each step.

Context: Patient `John Davis` had a past appointment on `12-06-2022` where they were diagnosed with a `headache` and
prescribed `paracetamol` medication as a painkiller. They are scheduled for a follow-up appointment on `16-06-2022`.

Step 1. The medical assistant opens the application and executes `get /n John Davis` to find the target patient. The
assistant notices John is at index 2. John Davis currently has 0 `PastAppointment`s and no `UpcomingAppointment`.

![AppointmentObjectDiagramBefore](images/AppointmentObjectDiagramBefore.png)

The values of John's default details have been hidden in the above diagram.

Step 2. The medical assistant creates a `PastAppointment` for John by executing `appt 2 on/12-06-2022 diag/headache
m/paracetamol`. The `PastAppointment` count is now at `1`.

![AppointmentObjectDiagramWithPastAppt](images/AppointmentObjectDiagramWithPastAppt.png)

Step 3. The medical assistant creates an `UpcomingAppointment` for John by executing `edit upcoming/16-06-2022`. John
now has an `UpcomingAppointment` associated with him.

![AppointmentObjectDiagramWithBothAppt](images/AppointmentObjectDiagramWithBothAppt.png)

### Get Features (By prefixes)

The get feature contains a series of sub-features that allows the user to get
a list of persons based on the prefixes inputted. It is implemented the same way as the `AddressBookParser` class,
but it matches the following prefix of the user input instead of the first command word.
By having a parent `GetCommand` class, we can have a series of sub-commands that inherits from it.
This way, new implementations of other items to be filtered when using the get command can be easily
added in the future.

There are 2 types of inputs for get commands, specifically those that only require a prefix (`/inp` & `/outp`) and 
those that require a prefix and parameters.

Below is a Sequence Diagram illustrating the implementation of `GetCommand` for get commands that only require a prefix.
The command `get /inp` will be used for this example.

![GetInpatientSequenceDiagram](images/GetInpatientSequenceDiagram.png)

This Sequence Diagram below illustrates the implementation of the `GetCommand` for get commands that require parameters
in addition to the prefix. The command `get /hw North` will be used for this example.

![GetHospitalWingDiagram](images/GetHospitalWingSequenceDiagram.png)

All get commands are implemented in the following steps:
1. User input prefix is matched in `GetCommandParser` class
2. Parser for the get command corresponding to the prefix is called and parses the user input
3. Specific child classes of `GetCommand` is instantiated and executed
4. The model is then updated such that the *filtered* list only displays patients whose details match the query
arguments of that prefix

#### Floor Number (/fn)

Getting the list of patients in the query floor number involves the following steps:
1. prefix "/fn" is matched in `GetCommandParser` class
2. a new `GetFloorNumberCommandParser` instance is created and parses the user input
3. a `GetFloorNumberCommand` instance is returned
4. the model is updated such that the *filtered* list only displays patients who are on the query floor number

Strict restrictions are placed to prevent querying and parsing of invalid floor numbers. Invalid floor numbers include
floor numbers less than 1, negative numbers and characters or strings. 

#### Hospital Wing (/hw)

Getting the list of patients in the query hospital wing involves the following steps:
1. prefix "/hw" is matched in `GetCommandParser` class
2. a new `GetHospitalWingCommandParser` instance is created and parses the user input
3. a `GetHospitalWingCommand` instance is returned
4. the model is updated such that the *filtered* list only displays patients who are in the query hospital wing

Strict restrictions are placed to prevent too many varieties of hospital wings. Hospital wings only accepts 
the following values (case-insensitive) `south` `north` `east` `west` as valid inputs. 

#### Next of Kin (/nok)

Getting the information of the next of kin of the list of query patient names involves the following steps:
1. prefix "/nok" is matched in `GetCommandParser` class
2. a new `GetNextOfKinCommandParser` instance is created and parses the user input
3. a `GetNextOfKinCommand` instance is returned
4. the model is updated such that the *filtered* list only displays queried patients' next of kin details

Details of the next of kin include the name, relationship to patient and phone number.

#### Ward Number (/wn)

Getting the list of patients in the query ward number involves the following steps:
1. prefix "/wn" is matched in `GetCommandParser` class
2. a new `GetWardNumberCommandParser` instance is created and parses the user input
3. a `GetWardNumberCommand` instance is returned
4. the model is updated such that the *filtered* list only displays patients who are in the query ward number

Strict restrictions are placed to prevent too many varieties of ward number inputs. This way the regex for searching
for ward numbers is simplified. Due to differing places having different ways of numbering their ward numbers, we
have standardised it to be in the format of `Uppercase Alphabet` + `3 Numbers`. For example, `A123`, `B241`, `C005`, etc.

#### Appointment Date (/appton)

Getting the list of patients in th query appointment date involves the following steps:
1. prefix "/appton" is matched in `GetCommandParser` class
2. a new `GetAppointmentByDateCommandParser` instance is created and parsers the user input
3. a `GetAppointmentByDateCommand` instance is returned
4. the model is updated such that the *filtered* list only displays patients who have the same query appointment date

To ease the parsing of date inputs, we have standardized the input query to be in the format of `dd-MM-yyyy`.

#### Patient type (`/inp` & `/outp`)

Getting the list of inpatients and outpatients involves the following steps:
1. prefix `/inp` or `/outp` is matched using an instance of `GetCommandParser`
2. the respective `GetInpatientCommand` or `GetOutpatientCommand` instance is created and returned
3. the model is updated such that the *filtered* list only displays inpatients or outpatients

If additional parameters are inputted (e.g. `get /inp hello world`), the extra parameters will be ignored, similar to 
how `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear` are executed.

#### Getting the past appointments of a patient (`/appt`)

Getting the past appointments of a patient involves the following steps:
1. prefix `/appt` is matched using an instance of `GetCommandParser`
2. a new `GetPastAppointmentCommandParser` instance is created and parses the user input (specifically the index inputted)
3. a `GetPastAppointmentCommand` instance containing the index of the patient to be updated is created and returned
4. the `GetPastAppointmentCommand` is executed, accessing the list of `PastAppointment` of the specified patient
   to be returned in a `CommandResult`
5. The list of `PastAppointment` will then be displayed in the `ResultDisplay`

#### Getting patients with an appointment on a specified date (`get /appton`)

Getting patients with an appointment on a specified date involves the following steps:
1. prefix `/appton` is matched using an instance of `GetCommandParser`
2. a new `GetAppointmentByDateCommandParser` instance is created and parses the user input (specifically the date inputted)
3. a `GetAppointmentByDateCommand` instance containing the date of the appointment is created and returned
4. the `GetAppointmentByDateCommand` is executed, accessing the list of `PastAppointment` of the specified patient
   to be returned in a `CommandResult`
5. the model is updated such that the *filtered* list only displays patients who have an appointment on the specified 
   date.

The date inputted is parsed using `LocalDate`

### New Add Command
The new `Add` Command incorporates support for the necessary fields for a patient, namely they are the: `NextOfKin`,
`PatientType`,`HospitalWing`, `FloorNumber`, `WardNumber` and `Medications` fields. The new command still follows the
flow of the old command, as illustrated in the Activity Diagram below.

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
![AddCommandParseArgsSequenceDiagram](images/AddCommandParseArgsSequenceDiagram.png)

As the Add Command now includes more fields for the patients, the Person class has also been updated to store these
fields, as shown in the class diagram below.

![PersonClassDiagram](images/PersonClassDiagram.png)

The usage of the Add Command remains the same as before.
