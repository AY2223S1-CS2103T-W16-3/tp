   line interface.

2. Download the latest `checkUp.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your checkUp instance.

4. Navigate to the home folder with `cd PATH_TO_FOLDER` through your command line interface.

5. Run `java -jar checkUp.jar` to start the app. The GUI similar to the below image should appear after startup.

6. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

   `<Enter>` will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`add`**`n/Amy Toh p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com nok/Jane Doe, Wife, 82858285 pt/inpatient hw/south fn/3 wn/D690
      m/panadol m/ibuprofen` : Adds a contact named `Amy Toh` to checkUp. 

    * **`delete`** `3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current patient list panel.

## Installation Guide

### System Requirements
Here is everything you need to install and set up checkUp. For the best possible experience, we recommend that you use checkUp on the following supported operating systems:

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux <br>
You will also require Java 11 or above to run checkUp. If you don't already have Java 11 or above on your system, head over to [Oracle's Java download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). 
To tell if you already have the correct version of Java installed on your system, refer to [Checking your system's Java version](#checking-your-systems-java-version).

### Installation Requirements
1. Download the latest `checkUp.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-3/tp/releases).

2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your checkUp instance.

3. Double click the file to start the app.

4. The GUI similar to the below will appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/ug-images/Ui-explanations.png)
   
## Troubleshooting   
### Checking your system's Java version

This section covers the technical issues you may run into while using checkUp.

**Checking your system's Java version**

To check that your system has the correct Java version (Java 11 and above) to run checkUp, you can follow the steps below:

Open your terminal.
* Windows
   * Use Win + S to open search.
  * Type in 'Terminal' to search for it and click on it to launch.

* macOS
  * Use Cmd + Space to open Spotlight search.
  * Type in 'Terminal' to search for it and click on it to launch.
* Linux
  * Use Ctrl + Alt + T to open the Terminal.
  * In your terminal, type in java --version and click enter.
The following image shows an example what will show up in macOS, but you can expect a similar result in Windows.


The number in the red highlight rectangle tells you the Java version installed. 
For example, the Java version installed on the example system is Java 11.0.16, which is sufficient to run checkUp as it is greater than Java 11.

If you do not see a similar result in the terminal after Step 3, or have an earlier version of Java, 
head over to [Oracle's Java download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to install Java.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:notebook: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `get /n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `get /n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [m/MEDICATION]` can be used as `n/John Doe m/Ibuprofen` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[m/MEDICATION]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `m/ibuprofen m/lozenges`, `m/ibuprofen` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## General Commands
The commands in this segment are essential commands needed for the app to run correctly 
and quality of life commands to improve the user experience.
These commands are:
* [Viewing a patient](#viewing-a-patient-view)
* [Clearing all data](#clearing-all-data--clear)
* [Viewing help](#open-the-help-page--help)
* [Exiting the program](#exiting-the-program--exit)
* [Mouse interactions](#mouse-interactions)
* [Keyboard shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts)

### Viewing a Patient: `view`

Displays the details of a patient specified by the index number from the patient list panel.

Format: `view INDEX`

* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Details are displayed on the patient details panel.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
On startup, the patient details panel will always default to the first patient if present.
<br>
It will also automatically focus onto the most recent patient added or edited.
<br>
When the current person displayed on the patient details panel is removed, it defaults to viewing the first patient
in the patient list panel if present, and empty otherwise.
</div>

**Upon Execution**

If the command was successfully executed, you should see something similar to the image below in the Command Result Box:
![View Appointment Command Result Box](images/ug-images/viewCommand/viewCommandResultBox.png)

If not, please follow the error message given and format above to enter the correct command.

<sub><sup>[back to top](#back-to-topt), [back to features](#features), [back to segment top](#general-commands)</sub></sup>

### Clearing all data : `clear`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:exclamation: **Caution:** Deleted patient records cannot be recovered.

</div>

Empties checkUp of all patients stored.

Format: `clear`

* All patients will be removed from storage.
* This command is **nuclear**, and cannot be reversed. It should only be executed when absolutely necessary.
* This command is provided for privacy reasons, or to start afresh.

### Open the Help Page : `help`

Opens the Help Window.

Format: `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits checkUp.

Format: `exit`

* GUI settings (window height and width) are preserved during this process.

<sub><sup>[back to top](#back-to-topt), [back to features](#features), [back to segment top](#general-commands)</sub></sup>

### Saving the data

checkUp has been created in such a manner that you do not need to manually save data. Simply executing commands saves
any data created or deleted from the application.

### Editing the data file

* checkUp stores data in the JSON format, improving readability and allowing for manually editing the data file.
* The data file can be found in `data/checkup.json` in the home folder where checkUp's `jar` file is stored.
* Care needs to be taken to follow data storage formats properly, or else the application will **reject** the data file.


### Mouse Interactions

Although CheckUp is built as a Command Line Interface application, it also supports the following mouse interactions:

#### Person List Panel:

* Double-clicking on patients in the Patient List Panel will automatically open their info in the Patient Details Panel.

Example:

* Double-clicking on the first patient `Alex Yeoh` will display his details on the Patient View Panel.

![Clicking on Patient List Panel Gif](images/ug-images/Person-List-Panel-Clickability.png)

#### Person Details Panel:

* Double-clicking on the fields in the Patient Details Panel will automatically prepare them for editing in the Command Input Box.

Example:

* If the patient is `Alex Yeoh`, double-clicking on his `email` will set the text in the Command Input Box to `edit 1 e/`.

![Clicking on Patient View Panel Gif](images/ug-images/Person-Details-Panel-Clickability.png)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Similar to other CLI applications, CheckUp supports a few keyboard shortcuts:
  * Navigate past commands with the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys.
  * Clear the text currently in the command box with `Ctrl + Shift + C`.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous checkUp home folder.
